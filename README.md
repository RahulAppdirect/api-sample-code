# Introduction

This is Yottaa API(OAuth2 stuff) sample code project. These samples are going to show you how to use Yottaa OAuth2 service and [Yottaa Users API](https://api.yottaa.com/UserApi.html), here we have three different languages, they are:  

* ruby
* php
* java

# Usage

### Ruby

All ruby sample code is under ruby directory, it is based on [sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/intro), and we use [oauth2 gem](https://github.com/intridea/oauth2) as the OAuth2 client. Firstly, you need to config your OAuth2 settings in ruby/oauth_client_sample.yml file, and you can register an account at [Yottaa Dev Site](https://dev.yottaa.com) for testing.

Then you can start the peoject use:

	$ ruby oauth_client_sample.rb
	
to start the server, then you can open localhost:4567 in your browser.
