oauth_client_sample.php contains all of my code for the sample PHP OAuth2 Client.

The sample client will fetch the user's email address, just as Lei Li's ruby client does.

The sample client will also display all of the user's sites, as well as the basic monitoring information for each site.

All other files are from a PHP OAuth2 Client implementation and can be found at the original github repo (https://github.com/adoy/PHP-OAuth2).

Slight modifications were made to the PHP-OAuth2 Client.
